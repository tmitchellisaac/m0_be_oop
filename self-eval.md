# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
# To be honest this last CFU was definitely the hardest, but I enjoy working through the problems and sandboxing ideas on both replit and the terminal. The hobbit problem was straightforward for me at first, but I had hard time figuring out how to increase the hobbit's age by one with the `celebrate_birthday` method, while also having it be remembered by another attribute's conditional. It would return a value that was one greater, but I couldn't get the other variables `is_adult` or `is_old` to accept the change and then change their values accordingly.
# I might need to revisit how I go about using external resources, because I ended up getting a result I wanted only through a lot of trial and error.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
# I was determined to solve the problem, so I ended up taking fewer breaks than I should have. But I am definitely learning the value of breaks as I push through these final problems. I really enjoy the times where I have a lot of time to work through this stuff, so keeping to shedule will be essential in Mod1
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
# I definitely want to remember to take breaks while dealing with a particularly tough problem. That will be a valuable skill to have. 
# I think that remembering my successful struggles in Mod0 will help me in the later Mods. I've had some confusing times, but have always figured it out eventually and have moved on knowing even more.
# Also, the power of peer review has been really eye-opening, the peer programming sessions have been quite fruitful everytime. I learned something new and useful from each of my peers in a short amount of time.
